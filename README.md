The model described is a physiologically relevant model of the peripheral human auditory system that is implemented in MATLAB.
To do this, the model contained parts to model the basilar membrane, inner hair cells, and the auditory nerve.
Code was written to simulate the various functions of the encoding of a signal performed by the inner ear.
The encoded signal was then decoded in order to assess the validity of the model.
A constant 2 Hertz (Hz) signal and a short voice recording were both run through the model that produced accurate and audible results.
The model has the capabilities to be utilized by auditory researchers to better understand pathologies of hearing diseases and improve understanding of the signal processing of the auditory system.
